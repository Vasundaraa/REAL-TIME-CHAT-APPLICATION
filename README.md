*DESCRIPTION*: The Real-Time Chat Application is a web-based messaging platform built using Node.js and React.js. It leverages the WebSocket protocol to establish a persistent, real-time connection between users, allowing them to send and receive messages instantly without delays. The application provides a dynamic and responsive user interface, which adapts to both mobile and desktop devices. It also includes message history, enabling users to view previous conversations even after reconnecting. The backend, powered by Node.js, handles message broadcasting to all connected clients in real time. This project demonstrates the power of WebSockets for real-time communication and showcases key features such as real-time messaging, message history, and responsive design, offering a scalable foundation for future enhancements like user authentication and file sharing.
